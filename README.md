## Description

Develop a basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks. The to-do web app allows users to add new items to a list, and items added to the list must be visible. A user can mark a task as “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks appear on a separate list titled "Completed Tasks". Additionally, users can view pending tasks that require completion. Tasks can also be deleted or edited from the list.

To increase the web app’s complexity or make it more detailed, the date and time when a task is added and/or completed can be recorded.
